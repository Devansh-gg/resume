    <h2>Letter</h2>
    <p><strong>To the woman I cherished deeply,</strong></p>
    <p>There are goodbyes that stay silent, and there are memories that never leave. This letter is both. You gave me something I didn’t even know I was missing — genuine love, deep connection, and the kind of presence that stays even when you’re not around.</p>
    <p>I know life moves forward, and so must you. But a part of me will always pause here — where we laughed, where we fought, and where we imagined a future together. If you ever wonder whether it all mattered — it did. More than words can hold.</p>
    <p>You were not just someone I loved. You were the woman I envisioned standing beside through every season of life. I may not be part of your tomorrow, but thank you — truly — for being my today.</p>
    <p><em>— Devansh</em></p>

    <h2>Short Message</h2>
    <p>Wherever life takes you, may it be kind. Just know — someone once loved you quietly, truly, and completely. And he always will.</p>
